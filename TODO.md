* check MFI math because it rarely reaches overbought/sold - correct
* split parabolic Sar?
* bband should also return the MA that it uses - done
* bulk icloud needs the return desciprtion updated - done
* figure out colors for second icloud, conversion (signals reversals, blue?) and base line (stop loss point, red?) are support and resistance, lagging span general support resistance (green?)
* go to Welles book to figure out ohw to chart volatility system - Stop and Reverse point should be charted 3 instance in tuple, charted similar to parabolic Sar
* get another asset (DOW) to correlate and do monthly and quarterly
* fibo retracement is wrong - removed
* value added index not working, multiplication is wrong, number gets too big, and you loop over to negatives... - replaced with return on investment
