* check MFI math because it rarely reaches overbought/sold
* split parabolic Sar? also check Welles defaults as they're currently sticking close to the prices
* bband should also return the MA that it uses
* bulk icloud needs the return desciprtion updated
* figure out colors for second icloud
* go to Welles book to figure out ohw to chart volatility system
* get another asset (DOW) to correlate and do monthly and quarterly
* fibo retracement is wrong
* value added index not working, multiplication is wrong, number gets too big, and you loop over to negatives...
